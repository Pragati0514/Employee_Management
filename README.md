# Employee_Management
This repository contains the source code for the Employee Management Project, as discussed in the videos on my YouTube channel: Catch the Code[https://youtu.be/e5HS1lNLVxs?si=33Wo6qIQtRW1tzls]. The project demonstrates how to handle basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a .txt file for data storage.
